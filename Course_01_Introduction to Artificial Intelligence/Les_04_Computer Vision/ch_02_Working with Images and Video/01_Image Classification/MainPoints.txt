1.HOW WE CAN APPLAY ML IN COMPUTER VISION
 -IMAGE classification
###########################################
Well we've looked at various ways to process images and extract features from
them and hopefully you've seen that to a computer images are just numeric arrays
on which mathematical and statistical operations can be performed now that
means that we can apply similar machine learning techniques to images just as we
do to any other data so for example we can train a classification model by
tagging images with a label like these images of cars and these images of
rockets then we can use the classification model to predict the
appropriate tags
